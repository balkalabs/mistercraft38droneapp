### About:

This app has been developped for [Mistercraft38's R6S drone project](https://github.com/Mistercraft38/Drone-rainbow-six).
It is meant to be used alongside a remote SCP Socket Server installed on drone.

/!\ Due to usage of cordova plugins, this app will not work on emulated browser! Only real device.

### With the Ionic CLI:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic cordova platform add android
$ sudo npm install
```

Then, to run it,  run:

```bash
$ ionic cordova run android
```

Substitute android for ios if on a Mac.
